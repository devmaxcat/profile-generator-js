## Reporting Bugs

### Before Reporting
- **Check for Existing Issues:** Look through the [bug tracker](issues?q=label%3Abug) to see if the issue has already been reported.
- **Verify the Bug:** Ensure the issue is a legitimate bug. Make sure you have read the [documentation]().
- If you’re seeking support, check [this section](#i-have-a-question) for guidance.

### Step 1: Submit an Issue
- Open a new issue using [this link](https://github.com/devmaxcat/profile-generator-js/issues/new).
- Do **not** label your issue; maintainers will handle that.
- Clearly describe:
  - The expected behavior.
  - The actual behavior.
  - Steps to reproduce the issue.
- Include as much context as possible, such as your OS, environment details, or relevant code snippets.

### Step 2: Wait for Feedback
- A maintainer will:
  - Attempt to reproduce the bug.
  - Label the issue as "bug" if confirmed.
  - Contributors can then start to implement a fix.
- If you are confident this is a bug, you can optionally proceed to Step 3 before receiving feedback.

### Step 3: Suggest Fixes
- If you’d like to fix the bug yourself:
  - Fork the repository and create a branch (see [branch naming conventions](#branch-naming-conventions)).
  - Implement your fix and submit a pull request linking to the issue.

## Suggesting Enhancements
Or features.
### Step 1: Submit an Issue
- Open a new issue using [this link](https://github.com/devmaxcat/profile-generator-js/issues/new).
- Label your issue with "enhancement."
- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue.
- Provide a detailed description of:
  - Current implementation
  - The proposed implementation and why it’s an improvement.
  - Any examples or references to similar features in other projects.

### Step 2: Wait for Feedback
- A maintainer will provide feedback, which may include:
  - Approval, along with implementation details.
  - Requests for clarification.
  - Rejection, with reasons.

### Step 3: Begin Implementation
- If your enhancement is approved:
  - Fork the repository and create a branch (see [branch naming conventions](#branch-naming-conventions)).
  - Implement your changes.
  - Submit a pull request with a link to the issue.

## Contributing to Documentation
To contribute to documentation:

1. **Fork the Repository:** Fork the repot.
2. **Create a Branch:** Use the naming convention `docs/<type>/<topic>`, where:
   - `<topic>` is the part of the documentation you are modifying (e.g., "readme" or "myMethod").
   - `<type>` reflects the nature of your changes:
     - `add`: Adding new sections to documentation.
     - `update`: Updating outdated or incomplete information.
     - `rewrite`: Improving clarity or structure of existing documentation.
     - `fix`: Correcting grammar, spelling, or syntax errors.
3. **Make Your Edits:** Update the relevant documentation files.
4. **Commit and Push:** Use descriptive commit messages and push your branch to your fork.
5. **Submit a Pull Request:** Create a pull request with a summary of your changes.

## Branch Naming Conventions

When creating a branch, follow these conventions for clarity and organization:

- For features or enhancements:
- `feature/<feature-name> enhancement/<enhancement-name>`
- For bug fixes:
- `fix/<bug-description>`
- For documentation:
- `docs/<type>/<topic>`
